# GameLift-Server-Protobuf

## What
`sdk.proto` file for [the offical Amazon GameLift Server SDK (C++, C#)](https://aws.amazon.com/gamelift/getting-started/#Amazon_GameLift_Server_SDK).

Before version **4.0.2** it was reversely created from the public available sources. Since **4.0.2** one person from AWS shared this file on the forum: [AWS GameTech topic](https://forums.awsgametech.com/t/differences-between-c-and-c-aws-gamelift-server-sdk/10812/6)

Latest supported *AWS GameLift Server SDK* is **4.0.2**. We will try to get regularly semi-official updates for the `sdk.proto` file from AWS GameLift team. But we will not be able to do so - we again can grab required information with reverse-enginnering.

AWS GameLift team promises that they later will publish Protobuf file officially as a part of the SDK. So hopefully someday this repository will be archived.

## Contributing
If you find any issues or just Protobuf file is outdated - feel free to create an issue or even create a pull-request! Any help is really appreciated!
